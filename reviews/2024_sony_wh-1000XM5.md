# Sony WH-1000XM5 Review 🎧

## Overview
The Sony WH-1000XM5 was my go-to headphone for immersive sound and top-tier noise cancellation. After using it extensively, I decided to sell it second-hand. Here's my brief experience:

### Pros 👍
- **Exceptional Noise Cancellation**: Perfect for focusing in noisy environments.
- **Comfortable Design**: Lightweight and great for long hours of use.
- **Sound Quality**: Clear and dynamic with deep bass.

### Cons 👎
- **Durability**: The headband felt slightly fragile over time.
- **Price**: Premium cost, though justified by the features.

### Final Thoughts
While I enjoyed the WH-1000XM5, I decided to sell it as I moved to lighter alternatives for portability.
