# Sony WH-1000XM5 Honest Review üéß

## Overview
A pair of earbuds I sold just one month after buying them.  

## Rate
For me, this device deserves no more than a **‚≠ê‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú© (actually, 0.5-star rating)**.

## The Review
I purchased the Sony WH-1000XM5 based on glowing reviews about its sound quality. However, I found it offered nothing significantly better than the AirPods Pro.  

As an iPhone user, I couldn‚Äôt fully experience the high-quality, near-lossless audio that Android users can enjoy with specific file formats. Lossless audio services are still limited for iOS, and even if they were available, I doubt I‚Äôd notice much of a difference with my listening habits.  

For me, what matters is convenience: seamless connection as soon as I put the earbuds on, decent ANC (Active Noise Cancellation), and ease of use without needing to open a separate app. Unfortunately, the Sony WH-1000XM5 required an additional app to access its full features, which felt cumbersome.  

If the sound quality had been so exceptional that it made up for these inconveniences, I might have kept them. But since I couldn‚Äôt take advantage of the superior sound quality on an iPhone, it was a disappointing experience overall. For me, this device deserves no more than a **0.5-star rating.**
